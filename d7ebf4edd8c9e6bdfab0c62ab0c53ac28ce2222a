Session prompts for commit d7ebf4e:

1. User changed Descope from cookie-based to token-based auth ("manage in response body"),
   but AppSync calls failed with 401 Unauthorized.

2. Added JWT claim debugging to authTokenProvider.ts to inspect the token. Discovered JWT
   issuer was `https://api.descope.com/v1/apps/{projectId}` but Terraform had
   `https://api.descope.com/{projectId}` - missing `/v1/apps/`.

3. Fixed OIDC issuer URL in all three AppSync terraform files (rebac, org, member) to use
   correct issuer URL with `/v1/apps/`. Applied with `terraform apply`.

4. User reported ShareModal "Next" button disappeared on tenant selection page. Found modal
   auto-advanced on tenant selection via useEffect. Fixed by adding explicit "Next" button
   that triggers loadMembers().

5. User requested code quality review of s3_service. Review identified:
   - Critical: Debug console.log statements exposing JWT tokens
   - Critical: ESLint configuration broken (plugin:security incompatibility)
   - High: Race condition in ImageGallery, TenantContext useEffect deps, input validation

6. Fixed all critical/high issues:
   - Removed all debug console.log statements from App.tsx, authTokenProvider.ts,
     appsyncClient.ts, LoginPage.tsx
   - Fixed ESLint by downgrading eslint-plugin-security to v2 and removing
     `plugin:security/recommended` from extends, adding rules manually
   - Fixed unnecessary type assertions in env variable declarations
   - Fixed curly brace requirements in TenantContext and useDescope
   - Fixed Promise-returning function issues by updating ConfirmDialog interface
   - Fixed input validation type safety with proper type guard in ImageUploader
   - Fixed test files with async without await issue

7. Final verification: ESLint passes with 0 errors/warnings, build and tests pass,
   deployed changes to S3/CloudFront.
